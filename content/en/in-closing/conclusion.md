## In closing
Congratulations! You have come a long way. Starting with an introduction to distributed ledger technology (DLT), you have created your first CorDapp and added sophistication through a series of improvements. Your CorDapp encapsulates working examples of the techniques you will use to create enterprise applications with Corda.

## What's next?
Please spread the word and recommend this training to everyone who is interested in getting into Corda. Remember, itâ€™s not just for coders. Non-technical students will appreciate the theory and proceed into depth that is appropriate for them. There is no need to complete the exercises to acquire a clear understanding of what Corda does and how it does it.
