The training repo provides solutions and starting points for each exercise that follows. See: https://github.com/corda/corda-training-code

In the previous module, you discovered the `samples/cordapp-example` project. You explored code, and learned what it does. You also ran it and inspected the database as the changes unfolded. Return to that example when you need to review your understanding of basic concepts and implementation.

You are ready to create your first project; your first CorDapp. This is the object of this module. This is a guided exercise with a solution. For the best learning result, work on your own before peeking at the solution.

The _solutions_ will introduce concepts that are important to understand even if your end goal is not to code. Be sure to peruse the explanation to deepen your understanding of important considerations.
